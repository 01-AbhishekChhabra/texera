Step 1-Prepare Index:
By default, there is a small data set in ./data-files/, and the data
set has already been written into an index located at ./index/.
If you are satisfied with the default data set and index, then move onto Step 2.

If you want to get results from more data sets, please put the data files into ./data-files/. 
Then, run RunIndexWriter.java in edu.uci.ics.textdb.perftest.run.
 
Step 2-Run Performance Tests:
In order to run the performance tests, please run RunPerftests.java in edu.uci.ics.textdb.perftest.run

Step 3-Review Test Results:
Performance test results can be found in the corresponding folders in ./data-files/results/.
For example, test results for dictionary matcher can be found in ./data-files/results/dictionary.
