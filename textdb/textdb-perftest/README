NOTE: Don't remove the file named .gitignore in any directory! 

Step 1-Prepare Index:
By default, there is a small data set named "abstract_100.txt" in ./data-files/, and the data
set has already been written into an index located at ./index/.
If you are satisfied with the default data set and index, then move onto Step 2.

If you want to get results from more data sets, please put the data files into ./data-files/. 
Then, run WriteIndex.java in edu.uci.ics.textdb.perftest.run.

Step 2-Prepare Queries:
By default, there is a sample query file named "sample_queries.txt" in ./data-files/queries/.
These queries are used in all operator performance test except regexmatcher.
The default regex queries is defined in RunPerftests.java.

If you are satisfied with the default queries, then move onto Step 3.

If you want to use your own queries, please put query files to ./data-files/queries/ 
or change the regex queries listed in RunPerftests.java.
In RunPerftests.java, you can see some operator performance tests take in a query file as a parameter.
Please change the query file name to the one you want in
 
Step 3-Run Performance Tests:
In order to run the performance tests, please run RunPerftests.java in edu.uci.ics.textdb.perftest.run

Step 3-Review Test Results:
Performance test results can be found in the corresponding folders in ./data-files/results/.
For example, test results for dictionary matcher can be found in ./data-files/results/queries/.
