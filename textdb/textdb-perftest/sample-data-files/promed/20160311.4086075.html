Tests showed 72 were actively infected with the virus. Of these 42 of the infected women, and all of the presumably non-infected ones, agreed to fetal ultrasound exams. Those ultrasounds found abnormalities in 12 of the infected women. The non-infected women all had normal ultrasounds. The exams did uncover some abnormal brain development. But they also detected 2 fetuses that died in utero during the last trimester; poor growth even without microcephaly; problems with the placenta; and one case that prompted an emergency C-section because of low amniotic fluid. <a href="http://6abc.com/health/evidence-of-zikas-risk-to-pregnant-women-grows/1232567/">http://6abc.com/health/evidence-of-zikas-risk-to-pregnant-women-grows/1232567/</a><br><br>Recent laboratory experiments published in the current issue of Cell showed that human forebrain-specific human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs), which can be further differentiated into cortical neurons are susceptible to Zika virus and reduced cell numbers.

Lancet 2016; doi: 10.1016/S0140-6736(16)00562-6<br>----------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Summary<br>-------<br>Background: Between October, 2013, and April, 2014, French Polynesia experienced the largest Zika virus outbreak ever described at that time. During the same period, an increase in Guillain-Barré syndrome was reported, suggesting a possible association between Zika virus and Guillain-Barré syndrome. We aimed to assess the role of Zika virus and dengue virus infection in developing Guillain-Barré syndrome.<br><br>Methods: In this case-control study, cases were patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome diagnosed at the Centre Hospitalier de Polynésie Française (Papeete, Tahiti, French Polynesia) during the outbreak period. Controls were age-matched, sex-matched, and residence-matched patients who presented at the hospital with a non-febrile illness (control group 1; n=98) and age-matched patients with acute Zika virus disease and no neurological symptoms (control group 2; n=70). Virological investigations included RT-PCR for Zika virus, and both microsphere immunofluorescent and seroneutralisation assays for Zika virus and dengue virus. Anti-glycolipid reactivity was studied in patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome using both ELISA and combinatorial microarrays.<br><br>Findings: 42 patients were diagnosed with Guillain-Barré syndrome during the study period. 41 (98 percent) patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome had anti-Zika virus IgM or IgG, and all (100 percent) had neutralising antibodies against Zika virus compared with 54 (56 percent) of 98 in control group 1 (p less than 0.0001). 39 (93 percent) patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome had Zika virus IgM and 37 (88 percent) had experienced a transient illness in a median of 6 days (IQR 4-10) before the onset of neurological symptoms, suggesting recent Zika virus infection. Patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome had electrophysiological findings compatible with acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN) type, and had rapid evolution of disease (median duration of the installation and plateau phases was 6 [IQR 4-9] and 4 days [3-10], respectively). 12 (29 percent) patients required respiratory assistance. No patients died. Anti-glycolipid antibody activity was found in 13 (31 percent) patients, and notably against GA1 in 8 (19 percent) patients, by ELISA and 19 (46 percent) of 41 by glycoarray at admission. The typical AMAN-associated anti-ganglioside antibodies were rarely present. Past dengue virus history did not differ significantly between patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome and those in the 2 control groups (95 percent, 89 percent, and 83 percent, respectively).<br><br>Interpretation: This is the 1st study providing evidence for Zika virus infection causing Guillain-Barré syndrome. Because Zika virus is spreading rapidly across the Americas, at risk countries need to prepare for adequate intensive care beds capacity to manage patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome.<br><br>--<br>Communicated by:<br>ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<br>&lt;promed@promedmail.org&gt;<br><br>[This report documents a strengthening relationship between Zika virus infections followed by the occurrence of GBS (Guillain-Barré syndrome).

N Engl J Med. 2016; doi: 10.1056/NEJMc1602964<br>----------------------------------------------------------------------<br>We describe a case of central nervous system infection with ZIKV that was associated with meningoencephalitis in an adult.<br><br>An 81-year-old man was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) 10 days after he had been on a 4-week cruise in the area of New Caledonia, Vanuatu, the Solomon Islands, and New Zealand; he was reported to have been in perfect health during that time. On medical examination, he was febrile (39.1 deg C [102.4 deg F]) and comatose (Glasgow Coma Scale score of 6 on a scale from 3-15, with lower scores indicating a reduced level of consciousness) with hemiplegia of the left side, paresis of the right upper limb, a normal response to tendon reflexes, and a Babinski sign on the left side. The patient's trachea was intubated and mechanical ventilation begun; a transient rash was observed within the next 48 hours.<br><br>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain was suggestive of meningoencephalitis. There were asymmetric subcortical white-matter hyperintensities on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging, multiple punctuated hyperintensities on diffusion-weighted sequences that were evocative of ischemic foci, and a slight hyperintensity of the right rolandic fissure that was evocative of meningitis. Computed tomographic angiography revealed an irregular narrowing of the right callosomarginal artery.<br><br>A lumbar puncture was performed on day 1, and findings on analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were suggestive of meningitis: the leukocyte count was 41 per cubic millimeter (with 98 percent polymorphonuclear leukocytes), the protein level was 76 mg per deciliter, and the ratio of CSF to blood glucose was 0.75. The patient was initially treated with amoxicillin, cefotaxime, gentamicin, and acyclovir, but these antimicrobial agents were stopped on day 5. Investigations in both CSF and blood for other infections were unrevealing (see the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this letter at NEJM.org), except for a positive result for ZIKV on reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction assay of the CSF (cycle threshold, 34). ZIKV was grown in culture from the CSF on a Vero cell line (see the Supplementary Appendix at the source URL above). These findings all support the diagnosis of ZIKV-associated meningoencephalitis.<br><br>Several electroencephalograms showed no direct signs that were suggestive of epilepsy during levetiracetam therapy (which was administered for the 1st time in the ICU because seizure had been suspected as one of the mechanisms of the initial consciousness disorder). Spontaneous arousal occurred within 24 hours after intubation, and mechanical ventilation was weaned on day 2. At that time, the patient was awake but had spatial delusion with visual and kinesthetic hallucinations and a persisting weakness (2/5) of the left arm. His neurologic condition continued to improve without specific treatment. He was discharged from the ICU on day 17, and his cognitive function was fully recovered by day 38. He had a residual weakness (4/5) of the left arm.

The day of admission, she developed acute lower back pain, paraesthesia on the left side of her body, and weakness in her left arm. On admission she had slight left-sided weakness and proximal pain of the left arm and leg, exacerbated on movement, but no fever or signs of meningism, and Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) 15. Laboratory analyses were normal except for raised leucocytes and polymorphonuclear leucocytes. Brain MRI was normal.<br><br>On day 2, she developed dysuria and urinary retention needing catheterisation, but no abnormal urinary frequency or urgency. The left-sided hemiparesis and pain worsened, and we noted loss of temperature sensation below the T2 dermatome on the left and T4 on the right, and bilateral Hoffman signs. Spinal MRI showed lesions of the cervical and thoracic spinal cord. The cervical lesion was enlarged, suggesting oedema (figure -- [available at the source URL above]). Conus medullaris and lumbar roots were normal, suggesting the bladder dysfunction could be linked to spinal damage. Electromyography and cerebrospinal fluid examination (including isoelectric focusing protein profile) were normal. We detected high concentrations of Zika virus on specific real-time reverse PCR (Eurobio, Les Ulis, France) in serum, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid on the 2nd day of her admission (9 days after symptom onset). PCR for varicella zoster and herpes simplex viruses, _Legionella_, and _Mycoplasma pneumoniae_ in her cerebrospinal fluid were negative. She had no serological signs of acute infection with cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr, chikungunya, or dengue viruses, syphilis, or Lyme disease; tests for HIV and human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV) were negative; and aquaporin-A antibodies, a marker of neuromyelitis optica, were absent.<br><br>We started methylprednisolone 1 g daily for 5 days. On the 7th day of admission her neurological condition improved and we could remove the catheter. 1 month after admission she had moderate weakness in both legs but was able to walk unaided. Repeat MRI showed reduced cervical spinal oedema.<br><br>The presence of Zika virus in the cerebrospinal fluid of our patient with acute myelitis suggests that this virus might be neurotropic. In addition to the usual clinical picture of myelitis she had severe pain. Absence of intrathecal immunoglobulins and normal brain MRI excluded acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. The neurotropism of flaviviruses such as dengue, Japanese encephalitis, and West Nile viruses, which might be responsible for invasive encephalitis and transverse or extensive myelitis is well documented. West Nile virus might also affect lumbosacral nerve roots in addition to the spinal cord and retrograde axonal transport from infected peripheral nerves has been shown. Zika virus infection should be considered in patients with acute myelitis living in or travelling from endemic areas, and further study should clarify the spectrum and incidence of neurological associations.<br><br>--<br>Communicated by:<br>ProMED-mail<br>&lt;promed@promedmail.org&gt;<br><br>[This is another example of when the number of cases of Zika virus infection grow, unusual symptoms are reported, including this case of myelitis.
