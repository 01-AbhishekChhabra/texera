Since the last Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) Zika epidemiological update on 12 May 2016, Argentina has confirmed vectorborne autochthonous transmission of Zika virus.<br><br>As mentioned in previous Zika epidemiological updates, trends observed in the Region of the Americas vary depending on the timing of the epidemic onset and timing of the seasonal period of mosquitoborne diseases. In general, countries and territories where the epidemic started later have exhibited upward trends.<br><br>Colombia<br>Following Brazil, Colombia was the 2nd country to report circulation of Zika virus in the Americas in 2015. Cases were initially reported in the Department of Bolivar and then spread to the rest of the country; as of epidemiological week (EW) 18 of 2016, 747 municipalities in the country have reported cases. Between EW 32 of 2015 and to EW 18 of 2016, a bimodal epidemic curve of Zika virus disease cases (suspected and confirmed) was observed. The peaks of the cases occurred in EW 5 of 2016 (6309 cases) and EW 13, 2016 (3609 cases) and have since demonstrated a downward trend.<br><br>Zika virus disease in pregnant women<br>Detection of Zika virus disease in pregnant women is being heightened in countries in the region due to risk of congenital syndrome associated with Zika virus infection. There are 21 countries and territories in the Americas reporting confirmed and suspected cases of Zika virus disease in pregnant women; this number remains the same since the last PAHO/WHO Zika epidemiological update on 12 May 2016.<br><br>Countries and territories reporting Zika virus disease in pregnant women:<br>Barbados, Dominican Republic, Honduras, Puerto Rico, Brazil, Ecuador, Martinique Saint Martin, Bolivia, El Salvador, Mexico, Venezuela, Colombia, French Guiana, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Guadeloupe, Panama, Dominica, Guatemala, Paraguay.<br><br>Acute flaccid paralysis trends in Bolivia<br>Following the description of historical trends in increasing reports of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) in children under 15 years of age, as seen with Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala, and Venezuela, the current situation in Bolivia is highlighted below.<br><br>Compared to 2015, a slight increase in reported AFP is noted in Bolivia for 2016 as of EW 18. If the notifications continue at the same rate in 2016, a bigger increase in comparison to 2015 can be expected by the end of the year. While AFP is the manifestation of a wide spectrum of diseases, this situation highlights the importance for countries and territories with Zika virus circulation to analyze the trends in reports of AFP and investigate any unusual increase of cases.<br><br>Of note, Bolivia, has not reported an increase of GBS cases to date.<br><br>Highlighted below are the surveillance results of pregnant women with Zika virus disease in Ecuador and Panama.<br><br>Ecuador<br>Between EW 52 of 2015 and EW 17 of 2016, Zika virus disease has been laboratory confirmed in 8 pregnant women in Ecuador.

Of these, the Brazil Ministry of Health confirmed 1384 cases of microcephaly by clinical, radiological and/or laboratory methods (207 have been confirmed by laboratory criteria). Out of the total reported cases, 2818 cases were discarded as being due to non-infectious causes or not fitting the case definition, and 3332 remain under investigation. The confirmed cases occurred in 499 municipalities, located in 26 out of 27 Federal Units.<br><br>Between EW 3 and EW 19 of 2016, the greatest number of microcephaly cases were confirmed in EW 4 (134 cases). During the same period, the range of cases investigated (confirmed and discarded) were between 80 and 381 (EW 12 and 4, respectively).<br><br>Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) and other neurological disorders<br>To date, 7 countries in the region have reported an increase in cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) with at least one case laboratory confirmed for Zika virus. Paraguay continues to report an increase in GBS cases, none of which have laboratory results confirming Zika virus infection; 5 other countries and territories have not recorded increases but identified Zika virus-associated cases of GBS.<br><br>Increase in GBS plus Zika virus lab confirmation in at least one case of GBS<br>Brazil, Colombia, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Honduras, Suriname, Venezuela<br><br>Zika virus lab confirmation in at least one case of GBS<br>French Guiana, Haiti, Panama, Puerto Rico, Martinique<br><br>Increase in GBS with no Zika virus lab confirmation in any of the cases<br>Paraguay<br><br>Trend of neurological syndromes in Colombia<br>Since 15 Dec 2015 until EW 18 of 2016, there were 517 cases of neurological syndromes reported in Colombia with history of febrile illness consistent with Zika virus infection. Of the total number of neurological syndromes, 65 per cent (335 cases) correspond to GBS. The epidemic curve of neurological syndromes shows a similar distribution to the Zika virus disease cases even though the neurological syndromes began 10 epidemiological weeks later and an elevation 2 weeks prior to the peak of Zika virus disease cases which occurred in EW 5 of 2016.<br><br>--<br>communicated by:<br>ProMED-mail<br>&lt;promed@promedmail.org&gt;<br><br>******<br>[2] Cases in various countries:<br>Americas<br><br>[Maps showing the location of the affected islands and countries in the Americas mentioned below can be accessed at<br><a href="http://healthmap.org/promed/p/35574">http://healthmap.org/promed/p/35574</a>;<br>North America at <a href="http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106">http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106</a>;<br>Central America <a href="http://healthmap.org/promed/p/39455">http://healthmap.org/promed/p/39455</a>; <br>Caribbean <a href="http://www.mapsofworld.com/caribbean-islands/">http://www.mapsofworld.com/caribbean-islands/</a> and<br>South America at <a href="http://healthmap.org/promed/p/6186">http://healthmap.org/promed/p/6186</a>. - Mod.TY]<br><br>Central America<br>---<br>Belize. 16 May 2016.

(conf) Zika virus (ZIKV) has been isolated from a female traveler who recently returned from Tonga to Brisbane, Queensland, Australia in 2016. The patient, in her 30s, was diagnosed with Zika virus infection using a ZIKV specific real-time RT-PCR1. The RT-PCR ZIKV positive serum sample was negative for flavivirus serology. A urine sample collected 4 days following the serum sample was also ZIKV RT-PCR positive. Several attempts to isolate virus from both the serum and urine were made using both cell culture (_Aedes albopictus_ C6/36 cells and African green monkey Vero cells) and suckling mice. A ZIKV isolate was recovered from the serum sample after one passage in suckling mouse brains 11 days post inoculation. This is the 1st known report of successful isolation of ZIKV from a human clinical sample in Australia.

Public health officials are gathering data on the health consequences of the infection, including the rate at which fetuses develop abnormally shrunken heads and brain damage, a birth defect called microcephaly.<br><br>Also on Friday [20 May 2016], the World Health Organization confirmed that the strain of Zika virus in Cape Verde, just off the western coast of Africa, is the same strain that is spreading in Brazil. Almost 200 pregnant women in Cape Verde have been infected, and the virus has been blamed for 3 cases of microcephaly there.<br><br>The rising numbers of pregnant American women testing positive -- Friday's [20 May 2016] figure is more than double the previous count of 113 -- reflect a new case definition used by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention rather than a surge in cases, according to Dr Margaret Honein, the chief of the agency's birth defects division.<br><br>No cases transmitted by mosquito have yet been reported in the 50 states. The number of infected pregnant women in this country began rising dramatically in February [2016], probably reflecting the spread of the Zika virus from Brazil to more countries visited by Americans.<br><br>Most of the 279 women are still pregnant, Dr Honein said, and fewer than a dozen have experienced "adverse outcomes," such as stillbirths, microcephaly or other congenital problems. A "relatively small number" of the infections clearly resulted from sexual transmission rather than mosquito bites, she added. But in most cases, it was difficult to determine how the women became infected because they had lived in or had traveled to areas where mosquitoes carrying the virus were biting.<br><br>[byline: Donald G McNeil, Jr]<br><br>--<br>communicated by:<br>ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<br>&lt;promed@promedmail.org&gt;<br><br>[This prospective monitoring is very useful to come up with a more precise estimate of occurrences of fetal malformations in women who were infected with Zika virus during pregnancy. One hopes that the monitoring can continue, as the number of infected pregnant women is likely to increase during the summer travel season, perhaps with additional cases should local transmission of the virus in the USA occur during the upcoming mosquito transmission season.<br><br>The details of the study above, entitled "Possible Zika virus infection among pregnant women -- United States and Territories, May 2016", appeared in the 20 May 2016 issue of CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/wr/mm6520e1.htm?s_cid=mm6520e1_w">http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/wr/mm6520e1.htm?s_cid=mm6520e1_w</a>). - Mod.TY]<br><br>******<br>[4] Microcephaly studies in mice, monkeys<br>Date: Wed 11 May 2016<br>Source: Science [edited]<br><a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/05/zika-causes-microcephaly-mice">http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/05/zika-causes-microcephaly-mice</a><br><br><br>By far the most alarming feature of the Zika virus now marching across South America and the Caribbean is its threat to fetuses. Last month [April 2016], the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention declared that "a causal relationship" exists between the virus and brain abnormalities in newborns, most noticeably a small head, known as microcephaly. But just how a mother's infection harms the fetus, and how to prevent the damage, is uncertain.<br><br>New animal models are now pointing to answers. Pregnant monkeys are showing hints of fetal damage. But the most dramatic results come from mice. Mouse studies published this week in Cell and its sister journal Cell Stem Cell and in Nature show precisely how the virus slows fetal growth, damages the brain, and leads to miscarriage. The 2 of them also prove for the 1st time in an animal model that Zika virus can cause microcephaly in fetuses.<br><br>Together, the findings indicate that the virus by itself can wreak havoc, says Michael Diamond, a viral immunologist at Washington University in St Louis in Missouri who led the Cell study. "Some people feel there are many cofactors like insecticides," Diamond says. "Our study suggests at least you don't have to invoke other things." And by providing an animal model for the fetal damage, the studies should also ease the path for testing potential vaccines and treatments.<br><br>Mice normally cannot sustain a Zika infection because the virus triggers secretion of interferons, molecules that bolster immune responses. Diamond's lab circumvented this problem by creating female mice that had a key interferon gene knocked out; in a 2nd experiment, they treated pregnant animals with an anti-interferon antibody. The team then injected pregnant females with a virus isolated from a person in French Polynesia; the isolate is 99 per cent genetically similar to the one now circulating in Latin America.<br><br>In the knockout mice, the virus replicated to higher levels than in those treated with the antibody, killing most of the fetuses. The researchers found high levels of Zika virus in the placentas -- 1000 times more than in the mother's blood -- supporting the hypothesis that the virus harms the placenta, which, in turn, cuts the blood supply to the fetus, Diamond says.<br><br>Pregnant mice treated with the antibody still made enough interferon to partially control the infection and allow the pups to survive. Mirroring effects seen in humans, they were born small, a condition known as intrauterine growth restriction.<br><br>In both sets of mice, the virus also turned up in fetal heads, Diamond says, suggesting that it causes brain damage directly as well as by impairing the placenta. That's consistent with earlier in vitro findings that Zika can infect and damage human neural precursor cells. Neither set of pups developed microcephaly, which Diamond says could be because the researchers infected the mothers so early during pregnancy that not much brain development had yet occurred.<br><br>The 2 other mouse experiments, published in Cell Stem Cell and Nature, did document microcephaly. Neither team manipulated their mice to make them more susceptible to the virus. In the Cell Stem Cell study, Zhiheng Xu of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing sidestepped the mice's natural resistance to Zika virus by injecting a Samoan isolate directly into fetal brains. In Nature, Fernanda Cugola of the University of São Paulo in Brazil and co-workers injected a Brazilian isolate into the tails of a strain of mice that are naturally immunocompromised. Diamond notes that the Brazilian-led team injected an "astronomical amount of virus" through the intravenous route, which may have sent the virus directly to the placenta and helped dodge the antiviral immune response.<br><br>Both studies found malformations associated with microcephaly, including what's known as cortical thinning and smaller brains. The 2 reports also showed that Zika virus infected and damaged neuronal stem cells harvested from mice and humans. "If you see consistent phenotypes in different models, the things that are happening are probably important," says Guo-li Ming of Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore, Maryland, who led the earlier studies of Zika in human neural progenitor cells.<br><br>The researchers who study these various mouse models acknowledge that they differ from humans in many critical ways. "It's very difficult to study humans directly," Diamond notes. Yet he stresses that these mouse models give insights into pathogenesis and will allow for high-throughput screening of drugs and vaccines against the virus.<br><br>Monkeys are naturally infected with Zika virus and are far closer to humans in many ways, and at least a half-dozen studies are under way. In an unusual twist for the primate research community, investigators from 4 US labs have been posting data from their monkey Zika experiments on their websites in near real time, before publication. "We decided that the best thing for the community was that information be made available as widely as possible and freely available," says David O'Connor, whose group at the University of Wisconsin, Madison is furthest along in studying Zika infection of pregnant monkeys.<br><br>One pregnant rhesus macaque that O'Connor's group is following was 50 days post-infection at last report, and a little more than halfway through her pregnancy. Sonograms of the fetus -- which are posted online -- "sort of" show evidence that the head circumference is small, but O'Connor and colleagues "are not drawing too much attention to it," he says, because it's not that far outside of the normal range. The group will know for sure after they perform a cesarean section on the mother, which will also let them obtain the placenta, normally eaten by rhesus mothers. "I hope we can accelerate the information about what's going on in people," he says.<br><br>O'Connor points out that Zika-infected monkeys do not perfectly reflect humans either, and he sees the various models as complementary. "We can learn a lot from the fact that pregnancies are quick in the mice, and you can do much larger experiments, but in monkeys, we can do experiments that are much more relevant to human pregnancy," he says. "Clearly, we have a lot of work to do, but these experiments are opening up the possibility that Zika's effects during pregnancy may be much more common than we initially thought."<br><br>[byline: Jon Cohen]<br><br>--<br>communicated by:<br>ProMED-mail<br>&lt;promed@promedmail.org&gt;<br><br>[Although the authors of these various studies point out that the experimental animals -- mice and monkeys -- are different from humans, they may provide some general insights into the pathophysiology of Zika virus infections that can lead to focused observations in human cases that occur in nature. - Mod.TY]</p><p></p><h2>See Also</h2>
