Among the 52 countries and territories, Marshall Islands, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and Trinidad and Tobago are the latest to report autochthonous transmission of Zika virus.<br>- The geographical distribution of Zika virus has steadily widened since the virus was 1st detected in the Americas in 2015. Autochthonous Zika virus transmission has been reported in 31 countries and territories of this region. Zika virus is likely to be transmitted and detected in other countries within the geographical range of competent mosquito vectors, especially _Aedes aegypti_.<br>- So far, an increase in microcephaly cases and other neonatal malformations have only been reported in Brazil and French Polynesia, although 2 cases linked to a stay in Brazil were detected in two other countries.<br>- During 2015 and 2016, 8 countries and territories have reported an increased incidence of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) and/or laboratory confirmation of a Zika virus infection among GBS cases.<br>- Evidence that neurological disorders, including microcephaly and GBS, are linked to Zika virus infection remains circumstantial, but a growing body of clinical and epidemiological data points towards a causal role for Zika virus.<br>- The global prevention and control strategy launched by WHO as a Strategic Response Framework encompasses surveillance, response activities, and research, and this situation report is organized under those headings. Following consultation with partners and taking changes in caseload into account, the framework will be updated at the end of March 2016 to reflect epidemiological evidence coming to light and the evolving division of roles and responsibilities for tackling this emergency.<br><br>--<br>Communicated by:<br>ProMED-mail<br>&lt;promed@promedmail.org&gt;<br><br>[Some uniformity in criteria and reporting will be valuable in order to compare information across the broad geographic areas where Zika virus is being transmitted, and will likely spread in the near future. - Mod.TY]<br><br>[The complete report is available at the source URL above. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]<br><br>******<br>[2] Cases in various countries:<br>Americas<br>North America<br>---<br>USA<br>- Sexual transmission. 23 Feb 2016.

No Zika virus-related hospitalizations or deaths among pregnant women were reported. Pregnancy outcomes among the 9 confirmed cases included 2 early pregnancy losses, 2 elective terminations, and 3 live births (2 apparently healthy infants and one infant with severe microcephaly); 2 pregnancies (approximately 18 weeks' and 34 weeks' gestation) are continuing without known complications.<br><br>- Animal model. 24 Feb 2016. (reported) 3 Rhesus monkeys experimentally infected with French Polynesia Zika virus with evidence of viremia and virus in urine in saliva.

(reported) The Blood and Tissue Center of Central Texas is putting in place screening criteria for prospective donors that go beyond federal recommendations to protect the blood supply from Zika virus contamination. The center is actively questioning prospective donors about their travel to Caribbean and Latin American countries where Zika outbreaks are occurring, rather than relying on individuals to read the materials and decide for themselves whether they can donate. Travelers to those countries won't be allowed to donate for 4 weeks, which matches the time frame recommended by the American Association of Blood Banks.<br><a href="http://www.mystatesman.com/news/news/central-texas-blood-bank-imposing-new-rules-out-of/nqYBJ/">http://www.mystatesman.com/news/news/central-texas-blood-bank-imposing-new-rules-out-of/nqYBJ/</a><br><br>- CDC travel advisory. 27 Feb 2016. (reported) "CDC Recommends that pregnant women consider not travelling to the Olympics," the advisory says. "If you have a male partner who goes to the Olympics, you may be at risk for sexual transmission." CDC's statement is the agency's 1st explicit warning for some travellers to stay away from the Games in Rio de Janeiro [5-21 Aug 2016], which has been expecting to draw as many as 400 000 tourists from around the world.<br><a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/sport/cdc-advises-pregnant-wome/2553802.html">http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/sport/cdc-advises-pregnant-wome/2553802.html</a><br><br>Central America<br>---<br>Costa Rica (Samara, Guanacaste province). 22 Feb 2016.

(Conf. and reported, edited) indirect evidence, strongly suggesting the presence of Zika, has been collected in Viet Nam, Cambodia, Thailand, Philippines, Indonesia, and Malaysia. More recently, the presence of Zika has been confirmed in several of these countries by RT-PCR and virus isolation. The Institut Pasteur du Laos, a department within the Lao Ministry of Health, started Zika virus surveillance in late 2015 in parallel of dengue survey in Vientiane Capital. No cases have been confirmed so far among the suspected cases recorded in Vientiane Capital since January 2016. To better assess the risk of Zika virus in Lao PDR, sample collections of the Institut Pasteur du Laos were retrospectively investigated for the presence of Zika virus. This study demonstrated the presence of Zika virus in a small proportion of the specimen tested (1.3 percent). Some cases of Zika-dengue co-infections have also been identified. Up to now, no potential neurologic disorders potentially linked to Zika virus infection (microcephaly; Guillain-Barré syndrome) have been reported in Laos. All positive patients including those with Zika-dengue co-infection, evolved favorably and without any apparent sequelae.<br>[ProMED-mail thanks Marc Grandam PhD (&lt;m.grandadam@pasteur.la&gt;), Darouny Phonekeo MD, Sompavanh Somlor MD, and Paul T Brey PhD, Institut Pasteur du Laos, for submitting this report.]<br><br>China (national). 23 Feb 2016.

PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2016; 10(2): e0004517<br>----------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Abstract<br>--------<br>Background: the rapid spread of Zika virus in the Americas and current outbreak of microcephaly in Brazil has raised attention to the possible deleterious effects that the virus may have on fetuses.<br><br>Methodology/principal findings: we report a case of a 20-year-old pregnant woman who was referred to our service after a large Zika virus outbreak in the city of Salvador, Brazil, with an ultrasound examination that showed intrauterine growth retardation of the fetus at the 18th gestational week. Ultrasound examinations in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters demonstrated severe microcephaly, hydranencephaly [most of the cerebral hemispheres absent and replaced with fluid], intracranial calcifications, and destructive lesions of posterior fossa, in addition to hydrothorax, ascites, and subcutaneous edema. An induced labor was performed at the 32nd gestational week due to fetal demise and delivered a female fetus. ZIKV-specific real-time polymerase chain reaction amplification products were obtained from extracts of cerebral cortex, medulla oblongata, and cerebrospinal and amniotic fluid, while extracts of heart, lung, liver, vitreous body of the eye, and placenta did not yield detectable products.<br><br>Conclusions/significance: this case report provides evidence that in addition to microcephaly, there may be a link between Zika virus infection and hydrops fetalis [abnormal accumulation of fluid in 2 or more fetal compartments] and fetal demise. Given the recent spread of the virus, systematic investigation of spontaneous abortions and stillbirths may be warranted to evaluate the risk that ZIKV infection imparts on these outcomes.<br><br>--<br>Communicated by:<br>ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall<br><br>[Additional evidence of fetal infection caused by Zika virus continues to accumulate with this additional case from Brazil. - Mod.TY]<br><br>******<br>[3] USA (TX): rapid, hospital-based diagnostic test<br>Date: Tue 23 Feb 2016<br>Source: Texas Children's Hospital [edited]<br><a href="http://www.texaschildrens.org/about-us/news/releases/first-rapid-detection-zika-test-now-available-through-collaboration-texas">http://www.texaschildrens.org/about-us/news/releases/first-rapid-detection-zika-test-now-available-through-collaboration-texas</a><br><br><br>Collaboration between 2 Texas Medical Center institutions has resulted in today's [23 Feb 2016] release of the country's 1st hospital-based rapid tests for the Zika virus.<br><br>Pathologists and clinical laboratory scientists at Texas Children's Hospital and Houston Methodist Hospital developed the Zika direct test in a matter of weeks as part of the LE and Virginia Simmons Collaborative in Virus Detection and Surveillance. This sponsored program was designed to facilitate rapid development of tests for virus detection in a large metropolitan area. The tests are customized to each hospital's diagnostic laboratory and will provide results within several hours. They can be performed on blood, amniotic fluid, urine or spinal fluid, according to James Versalovic, MD, PhD pathologist-in-chief at Texas Children's and leader of the Texas Children's Zika test development team, along with James Dunn, PhD, director of medical microbiology and virology at Texas Children's.<br><br>Zika virus, which is mostly transmitted through mosquitoes, is a flavivirus that contains RNA as its genetic material. The new diagnostic test identifies virus-specific RNA sequences to directly detect Zika virus.<br><br>"With travel-associated cases of the Zika virus becoming more prevalent in the United States, coupled with the looming increase in mosquito exposure during spring and summer months, we must be prepared for a surge of Zika testing demand," said Versalovic. "We must provide answers for anxious moms-to-be and families who may experience signs and symptoms or may simply have travel history to endemic areas."<br><br>Before this test was developed, physicians faced the possibility of long delays of testing in local and state public health laboratories and the Centers for Disease Control.<br><br>"Hospital-based testing that is state-of-the-art enables our physicians and patients to get very rapid diagnostic answers. If tests need to be repeated or if our treating doctors need to talk with our pathologists, we have the resources near patient care settings," said James M Musser, MD, PhD, Chair of the Department of Pathology and Genomic Medicine at Houston Methodist Hospital and leader of the Houston Methodist test development team, along with Randall J Olsen, MD, PhD, director of the molecular diagnostics laboratory.<br><br>Musser said the test was designed to detect the genetic material of the virus, its RNA, so that virus is directly detected in pregnant women and any other adult or child with this virus infection. This test is specific and can distinguish Zika virus infection from dengue, West Nile, or chikungunya virus infections. Every viral particle contains genes in its RNA and these RNA sequences are directly detected during pregnancy in amniotic fluid or anytime in blood, spinal fluid or urine.<br><br>"This is a significant development as health authorities are recommending all pregnant women who have traveled to a place with a Zika virus outbreak get tested," Musser said.<br><br>At the current time, only registered patients at Texas Children's or Houston Methodist hospitals can receive the test but the labs will consider referral testing from other hospitals and clinics in the future.<br><br>The test will be initially offered to patients with a positive travel history and symptoms consistent with acute Zika virus infection such as a rash, arthralgias [joint pain] or fever, or asymptomatic pregnant women with a positive travel history to any of the affected countries. The World Health Organization is now advising pregnant women to consult their doctors before traveling to places with Zika virus outbreaks and consider delaying travel. The CDC issued similar guidelines to American women last month [January 2016].<br><br>--<br>Communicated by:<br>ProMED-mail<br>&lt;promed@promedmail.org&gt;<br><br>[A decentralized diagnostic test that is sensitive enough to differentiate between Zika, dengue, and chikungunya virus infections is urgently needed, especially in countries where centralized diagnostic laboratories are being overwhelmed by thousands of cases, such as Brazil and Colombia. Although the details concerning the test are not provided in this report, it appears to be based on RT-PCR technology. Details about the test and its sensitivity and specificity are awaited with considerable interest.<br><br>A 26 Feb 2016 report indicated that the USA FDA granted emergency use of a new CDC test for the Zika virus. "The Zika MAC-ELISA can help determine whether a person has been recently infected with the virus," said Julie Villanueva, who is with the agency's Zika response team. However, the test can result in false positives if the person is infected with another related flavivirus such as dengue. Therefore, positive or inconclusive tests should be followed up with additional screening to confirm a Zika diagnosis. A false negative can result when a person does not have enough virus proteins to be detected, which could be the case when someone is nearly recovered. Cross-reactivity with dengue virus could be a significant problem, since dengue viruses are circulating in areas where Zika virus is present. Dengue and Zika viruses are all transmitted by _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes. - Mod.TY]</p><p></p><h2>See Also</h2>
