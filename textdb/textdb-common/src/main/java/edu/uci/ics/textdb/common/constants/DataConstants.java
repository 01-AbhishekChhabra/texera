     * KeywordMatchingType: the type of keyword matching to perform. <br>
     * Currently we have 3 types of keyword matching: <br>
     * 
     * SUBSTRING_SCANBASED: <br>
     * Performs simple substring matching of the query.
     * Source tuples are provided by ScanSourceOperator. <br>
     * 
     * CONJUNCTION_INDEXBASED: <br>
     * Performs search of conjunction of query tokens. 
     * The query is tokenized into tokens, with each token treated as a separate keyword. 
     * The order of tokens doesn't matter on the source tuple. <br>
     * 
     * For example: <br>
     * query "book appointment" <br>
     * matches: "book appointment with the doctor" <br>
     * also matches: "an appointment to pick up book" <br>
     * <br>
     * 
     * 
     * PHRASE_INDEXBASED: <br>
     * Performs phrase search of the query.
     * The query is tokenized into tokens, with stopwords treated as placeholders.
     * The order of tokens matters on the source tuple. A stopword matches an arbitary token. <br>
     * 
     * For example: <br>
     * query "book appointment" <br>
     * matches: "book appointment with the doctor" <br>
     * doesn't match: "an appointment to pick up book" <br>
     * 
     * Example of stopword as placeholders: <br>
     * query "nice a a person":
     * matches "nice and beautiful person" <br>
     * matches "nice gentle honest person" <br>
     * doesn't match "nice person" <br>
     * doesn't match "nice gentle person" <br>
     * <br>
     * 
     * A list of stopwords:
     * "a", "an", "and", "are", "as", "at", "be", "but", "by",
     * "for", "if", "in", "into", "is", "it",
     * "no", "not", "of", "on", "or", "such",
     * "that", "the", "their", "then", "there", "these",
     * "they", "this", "to", "was", "will", "with"
